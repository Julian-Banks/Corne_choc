The baseline decisions: 
Type: corne
Switch: Chocolate 
Leds: Yes 
Wireless: Maybe but I think yes 
OLED: Yes 
Hotswap sockets: Maybe Idk

## Wireless vs Wired 

I really like the idea of wireless. 

**Wired**
use a Pro Micro microcontroller and QMK is used for the firmware.

Pros:
- Seems to be more standard?
Cons:
- ? 

**Wireless**
Use a Nice!Nano (v2 has built in charging) and ZMK is used for firmware. 

Pros:
- Fucken wireless!
Cons: 
- less out there with info on it? 
- LEDs may be a big power drain and not really be worth it.
